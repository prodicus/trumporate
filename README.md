# Trumporate

[![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/prodicus/trumporate.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/prodicus/trumporate/)

Post random rants by Donald Trump found based on what he has spoken on and around the internet and his speeches. Uses
[markovipy](https://github.com/prodicus/markovipy) in the background to generate sentences using Markov chains.
